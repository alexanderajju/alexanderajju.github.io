I"™<p>Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates is called the operand.</p>

<p>Python divides the operators in the following groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
  <li>Assignment operators</li>
  <li>Comparison operators</li>
  <li>Logical operators</li>
  <li>Identity operators</li>
  <li>Membership operators</li>
  <li>Bitwise operators</li>
</ul>

<p>| Operator | Meaning | Example 
| â€”â€”â€“ | â€”â€”- | â€”â€”-</p>
